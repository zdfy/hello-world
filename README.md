# hello-world
first repository

We going to raise up from the ashes and shine like the brightest star in the sky. No one will deter our rapid ascension from the material world and strike down the oppressors called junk food.

Our first plan of action begins with learning the basics of Git
Where we can utilize the version control features to enable clear communication channels for our members
and review their commits from their local repositories
